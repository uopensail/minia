## Introduction
Minia aims to solve the discrepancies often encountered between feature processing during model training and inference. By leveraging a configuration-driven approach, users can define feature transformations using intuitive expressions, ensuring that the same transformations are applied consistently across different stages of model deployment.

## Features
### Custom Expression Design with ANTLR
Minia utilizes ANTLR to design custom expressions for feature transformation. This allows users to define complex feature transformations in a straightforward manner. 

### Configuration-Based Processing
Minia supports configuration-based processing using the TOML format, which simplifies the specification and management of feature transformations. The configuration system incorporates several key optimizations to enhance processing efficiency and performance:

- Expression Deduplication: Automatically identifies and removes duplicate expressions, reducing unnecessary computations and improving clarity.

- Constant Propagation: Analyzes and substitutes constant values directly into expressions wherever possible, reducing runtime calculations and enhancing execution speed.

- Constant Folding: Evaluates constant expressions at compile time instead of runtime, minimizing computational overhead.

- Common Subexpression Elimination: Detects and eliminates repeated subexpressions within the transformations, optimizing resource usage by avoiding redundant calculations.


Example Expressions:
```python
expressions = ['x = 5 + 5 + h', 'y = sqrt(x)', 'z = y * y']

```

### FlatBuffers-Based Feature Input
Features are inputted in FlatBuffers format, and Minia supports a variety of data types to handle diverse data inputs. This flexibility ensures that Minia can be integrated into various data workflows.

## Installation
Minia can be easily installed as a Python package using the provided setup.py. This allows for seamless integration into existing Python projects.
```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
Minia's Python interface makes it easy to apply feature transformations. Below is a basic usage example:

```python
import pyminia

# Example configuration
m = pyminia.Minia(['x = 5 + 5 + h', 'y = sqrt(cast(x))', 'z = y*y'])
print(m({"c": {"type": 0, "value": 5}}))

# output: {'a': 1, 'b': 6}
```

## Expressions
The expressions are written in strings , which define how features should be transformed. This approach simplifies the process of updating and managing feature transformations.

FlatBuffers input for features:

Since FlatBuffers does not provide built-in support for map or dictionary-like data structures, we implemented a design strategy that flattens key-value pairs into linear structures, effectively working around this architectural constraint while maintaining serialization efficiency.

```flatbuffers
// features.fbs
// /opt/homebrew/Cellar/flatbuffers/25.2.10/bin/flatc --cpp features.fbs
namespace minia;

table FlatFloatArray {
    value: [float];
}

table FlatFloatValue {
    value: float;
}

table FlatInt64Array {
    value: [int64];
}

table FlatInt64Value {
    value: int64;
}

table FlatStringArray {
    value: [string];
}

table FlatStringValue {
    value: string;
}

table FlatNil {}

union FlatValue {
  FlatInt64Value,
  FlatFloatValue,
  FlatStringValue,
  FlatInt64Array,
  FlatFloatArray,
  FlatStringArray,
  FlatNil
}

table FlatFeature {
  name: string (key);
  value: FlatValue;
}

table FlatFeatures {
  values: [FlatFeature];
}

table FlatMaterial {
  id: string (key);
  features: FlatFeatures;
}

table FlatMaterialCollection {
  version: string;
  meterials: [FlatMaterial];
}
